# 🏔️ Landlab Real-World Simulation 🚀

Welcome to the most **dynamic, real-world Landlab simulation** you’ll find! This project doesn’t just model landscapes—it brings them to life, blending natural forces and human activity over hundreds of thousands of years. If you want to see how mountains, rivers, cities, and farms all compete and cooperate on the land, you’re in the right place.

## 🌟 Why You'll Love This Project

- **Real DEM Data**: Not just a toy model—this uses actual topography from the Himalayas!
- **Epic Timescales**: Simulate 500,000 years in minutes. Time travel, anyone? ⏳
- **Human + Nature**: Urban sprawl, farming, rainfall, rivers, landslides… all together!
- **Visuals Galore**: 2D, 3D, time series, and more—your eyes won’t get bored.
- **Easy to Tweak**: Change parameters, regions, or processes and make it your own.

## 🎉 What Makes This Simulation Special?

- **Not Just Theory:** Real data, real processes, real human impacts.
- **All-in-One:** Combines hydrology, geomorphology, and human land use.
- **Visual Storytelling:** Instantly see how rainfall, rivers, and cities shape the land.
- **Educational & Expandable:** Great for teaching, research, or just geeking out.

## 🖼️ Screenshots

- 3D topography from two angles!
- Rainfall and river networks evolving over time!
- Urban and agricultural land use spreading across the grid!
- Erosion, deposition, and landslide risk maps!

*(Check the `output_dir` for all the visuals!, Note: there are many plots, So adjust the timestep. Also you can make a gif to understand the notion in better way)*

## 🤔 Can I Hack This?

Absolutely!  
- Change the region, tweak rainfall, add new processes, or model your own city.
- All components are modular—swap them in or out as you like.
